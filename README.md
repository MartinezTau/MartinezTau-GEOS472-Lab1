Reflective Analysis:
  The purpose of this map was to highlight the avialable mental health and addiction services centers in BC, displaying both locations and concentrations of these locations, and potentially highlight areas which may be lacking in available services. The aimed to target a general audience and show what services were avaialble and where, in a format that was easily understandible and digestible. The data was taken from the BC Open Data Catalogue, hence the focus on the Province of BC.

  The base map I chose was a simple monochromatic black map that listed both cities, roadways, water ways and topography, as I wanted a vissual emphasis on the site locations and prevelance. Furthermore, I chose to highlight locations in a range of purple colours, as I felt it added vibrance to the data in psycologically calming, non aggresive colour way. I chose to lighten the colour of the water layers, to provide a better contrast of the borders between land and sea, as well as outline how more remote areas may be more islolated due to the prefelance of topography or water bodies/ways. I chose to stick with the 3 preset variables for size of the heatmap, due to the size of the data, as I felt a greater range of variable sizes caused the data to become too uniform. The heatmap style was selected, as it allowed for the density of service site locations to be highlighted, as well as remain as point values for the ease of adding interactivity to the map.

Map Critique:
  Having had my partner take a look and interact with my map, they felt that it was easy and intuitive to use, noting that they liked the purple heatmap on the black background. She liked the interactivity added to the map, and being able to see what service each location offered. However, she did add that it would have been interesting to have divided the data by service type, while keeping the heatmap, which would allow the user to see the concentrations of locations by services they offer, and quickly identify areas with a high prevelence of certain types of services, rather than just looking at center locations more broadly.
